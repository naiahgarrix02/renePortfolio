        My expertise lies in translating UI/UX
        <br />
        designs into functional, pixel-perfect <br />
        interfaces and optimizing front-end <br />

          Over the years, Iâ€™ve collaborated with cross-functional teams to build
          scalable
          <br />
          front-end architectures, design systems, and interactive experiences
          that prioritize <br />
          performance and user engagement.
          <br />
          <br /> I care deeply about code quality, accessibility, and creating
          intuitive digital products
          <br /> that solve real problems.
          <br />
          <br /> Whether it's building from scratch or optimizing existing
          systems, I bring a strong eye
          <br /> for detail, a user-first mindset, and a commitment to
          delivering high-quality solutions.
